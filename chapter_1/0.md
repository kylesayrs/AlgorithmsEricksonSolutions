Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that determines, given a legal
arrangement of standard pieces on a standard chess board, which player will win
at chess from the given starting position if both players play perfectly.
[Hint: There is a trivial one-line solution!]

```
DetermineWinner(board, first_turn):
    turn <- first_turn
    while (not board.finished) {
        board <- best_move(board, turn)
    }
    return turn
```

In the worst case, a chess game can go on infinitely (depending on the ruleset). In any case, the algorithm scales with board size

```
DetermineWinner(board, first_turn):
    return first
```

Intuition says that if both players play perfectly, the player who moves first will always win. While I think this is the solution that Erickson was looking for, this claim requires proof and is not true for all cases (for example, nim). Outside [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-player_and_second-player_win) has progressed to the point of proving that that chess is either a first-player win or draw game.
